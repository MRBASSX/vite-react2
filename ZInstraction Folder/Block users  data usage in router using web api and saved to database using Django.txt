Django **can** store data on Firebase, but **not natively**—you’ll need to use external libraries or Firebase's REST API/SDKs to make it work.

Here’s a breakdown of your options:

---

### 🔧 1. **Use Firebase Admin SDK (Python)**

You can use the [Firebase Admin SDK](https://firebase.google.com/docs/admin/setup) for Python to interact with:

* **Firestore** (Firebase’s NoSQL database)
* **Firebase Realtime Database**
* **Firebase Authentication**
* **Firebase Storage**

📦 Install it:

```bash
pip install firebase-admin
```

🧩 Example usage (for Firestore):

```python
import firebase_admin
from firebase_admin import credentials, firestore

cred = credentials.Certificate('path/to/your-service-account-key.json')
firebase_admin.initialize_app(cred)

db = firestore.client()

# Add data
doc_ref = db.collection('users').document('user_id')
doc_ref.set({
    'name': 'Alice',
    'email': 'alice@example.com'
})
```

---

### ⚙️ 2. **Use Firebase REST API**

You can also use standard Python HTTP libraries (like `requests`) to communicate with Firebase via its REST API.

For Realtime Database:

```python
import requests

url = 'https://your-project-id.firebaseio.com/users.json'
data = {
    'name': 'Alice',
    'email': 'alice@example.com'
}
response = requests.post(url, json=data)
```

---

### 🧱 Considerations

* Firebase is **NoSQL**, while Django's ORM is designed for **relational databases** (PostgreSQL, MySQL, etc.).
* You **won't be able to use Django models or migrations** with Firebase directly.
* You’ll be managing Firebase data through **custom services or utility functions**.
* If you're integrating with Firebase Auth, consider replacing Django’s default auth system or syncing them carefully.

---

### ✅ When to use Firebase with Django

* You’re building a hybrid stack (e.g., mobile app with Firebase + admin panel with Django).
* You want to use Firebase for **real-time features or mobile integration**, and Django for **backend logic or dashboards**.

You’re working with TP-Link TL‑WR840N and Archer C64 routers — both **don’t have public APIs**, but there **is** a way to control them through the internal web interface via HTTP calls.

---

## 🔧 How to Block Devices via Web Requests

### 1️⃣ Referer-based “authentication bypass” (TL‑WR840N)

Turns out, **TL‑WR840N** firmware has a vulnerability: if you include a `Referer: http://<router>/mainFrame.htm` header in HTTP requests to its `/cgi/` endpoints, you can execute commands like adding firewall or access-control rules *without logging in*—though it’s **undocumented** and may vary by firmware ([vulners.com][1]).

**Workflow:**

* Craft a proper POST request to the cgi endpoint for access control.
* Include the correct `Referer` header.
* Send parameters (like MAC address) to add a rule.

### 2️⃣ Archer C64 (newer models)

Modern TP-Link routers like **Archer C64** generally use their **“Tether” mobile app** or web UI, but often these just make internal API calls that you can replicate once you capture them with Chrome/DevTools ([manualsdump.com][2]).

**Workflow:**

* Block a device manually in the Tether app.
* In DevTools, capture the AJAX request (endpoint URL, method, JSON payload, tokens).
* Reproduce this in Python with `requests`.

---

## ✅ Example: TL‑WR840N in Python

```python
import requests

ROUTER = "192.168.0.1"  # adjust
MAC = "E4:95:6E:12:34:56"

session = requests.Session()
url = f"http://{ROUTER}/cgi/acl.exe"  # or the real endpoint
headers = {
    "Referer": f"http://{ROUTER}/mainFrame.htm",
    "Content-Type": "application/x-www-form-urlencoded",
}
data = {
    "operation": "add",
    "mac": MAC,
    "desc": "Blocked by Django",
    "enable": "1"
}
resp = session.post(url, headers=headers, data=data)

print("200 OK" if resp.status_code == 200 else resp.status_code, resp.text)
```

⚠️ You’ll need to test the correct endpoint & parameters — check DevTools to find the real URL and payload.

---

## 📲 Archer C64 Approach

1. Open Tether or web GUI → block a client.
2. Inspect network requests in DevTools → note the endpoint URL, payload, headers (especially cookies or tokens).
3. Replicate via Python like this:

```python
import requests

session = requests.Session()
session.headers.update({
    "Authorization": "Bearer ...",  # from captured request
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
})
payload = {"mac": MAC, "action": "block"}
resp = session.post("http://192.168.0.1/api/client/block", json=payload)
```

You'll need to replicate the *exact* request format.

---

## 🧩 Step 3: Integrate with Django

```python
# views.py
import requests
from django.http import JsonResponse
from .models import UserDevice

def block_device(request, id):
    dev = UserDevice.objects.get(pk=id)
    MAC = dev.mac_address

    session = requests.Session()
    # Add headers/cookies as required
    session.headers.update({"Referer": f"http://{ROUTER}/mainFrame.htm"})
    r = session.post(f"http://{ROUTER}/cgi/acl.exe", data={"operation":"add","mac":MAC,"enable":1})

    if r.status_code == 200:
        dev.blocked = True
        dev.save()
        return JsonResponse({"status":"blocked"})
    return JsonResponse({"status":"error", "code": r.status_code})
```

You can similarly log to Django models and create an unblock endpoint.

---

## ⚠️ What I Need from You to Proceed

1. Use your router’s web GUI to manually block a device.
2. In your browser’s Developer Tools (Network → XHR), capture:

   * **Request URL**
   * **Method (POST/GET)**
   * **Payload** (you can copy as cURL)
   * **Headers** (especially Referer, cookies, or tokens)
3. Share that captured request (screenshot or cURL text).

Once I have that, I can generate **exact Python + Django code** for automating it reliably.

Let me know when ready!

Great — you're choosing **Option 3: Reverse-engineer the router’s web interface** to block users and log data into Django.

This is **possible** but comes with these caveats:

* It’s **not officially supported** by TP-Link, D-Link, or Huawei.
* You’ll need to inspect **exact HTTP requests** your router makes when you block a user from its admin panel.
* You’ll likely need to **maintain login sessions**, **parse tokens**, and handle cookies manually.

---

## ✅ Here's How to Do It Step-by-Step

---

### 🧰 STEP 1: Inspect Your Router’s Web Panel

#### 🧪 Use Chrome/Firefox DevTools:

1. Log in to your router’s web interface (e.g. `http://192.168.0.1`).
2. Go to **Network > XHR/Fetch** tab.
3. Try blocking a user manually from the interface.
4. Look for:

   * The request URL (e.g. `http://192.168.0.1/api/block_device`)
   * Request method (POST/GET)
   * Request headers
   * Form/body data (e.g. IP or MAC address)
   * Any **authentication tokens or cookies**.

---

### 🧪 Example: TP-Link (Hypothetical)

When you block a device in the UI, DevTools might show this:

```http
POST http://192.168.0.1/userRpm/AccessCtrlAccessRulesRpm.htm?add=1
Headers:
  Cookie: Authorization=Basic YWRtaW46YWRtaW4=
Body:
  mac=E4:95:6E:12:34:56&desc=Blocked+Device&enable=1
```

---

### 🐍 STEP 2: Simulate the Same Request in Python

Here's an example using Python `requests`:

```python
import requests
from requests.auth import HTTPBasicAuth

# Your router login
username = "admin"
password = "admin"

# Blocked MAC address
mac_to_block = "E4:95:6E:12:34:56"

# Start session
session = requests.Session()

# Log in (TP-Link uses Basic Auth, older models)
session.auth = HTTPBasicAuth(username, password)

# Construct the request URL (you'll get this from DevTools)
url = "http://192.168.0.1/userRpm/AccessCtrlAccessRulesRpm.htm?add=1"

# Build POST data
data = {
    "mac": mac_to_block,
    "desc": "Blocked by Django",
    "enable": "1"
}

# Send the request
response = session.post(url, data=data)

if response.status_code == 200:
    print("Blocked successfully")
else:
    print("Failed:", response.text)
```

---

### 🧱 STEP 3: Trigger from Django

In your Django view:

```python
from django.http import JsonResponse
from .models import UserDevice
import requests
from requests.auth import HTTPBasicAuth

def block_user(request, user_id):
    user = UserDevice.objects.get(pk=user_id)
    mac = user.mac_address

    session = requests.Session()
    session.auth = HTTPBasicAuth('admin', 'admin')  # your router credentials

    url = "http://192.168.0.1/userRpm/AccessCtrlAccessRulesRpm.htm?add=1"
    data = {
        "mac": mac,
        "desc": "Blocked via Django",
        "enable": "1"
    }

    response = session.post(url, data=data)

    if response.status_code == 200:
        user.blocked = True
        user.save()
        return JsonResponse({"status": "success"})
    else:
        return JsonResponse({"status": "error", "details": response.text})
```

| 🧪 **Trial and error**  | Each router model has slightly different request formats. You need to test each.  |

---

## 📋 Next Step

To proceed, I need:

1. The **exact router model** (e.g., TP-Link Archer C6, Huawei HG8546M),
2. A screenshot or copy of the **HTTP request** when you manually block a device (from DevTools),
3. Optional: the form data or token if any is involved.

Send me that info, and I’ll help you write exact working Python/Django code tailored to your router.










Thanks — since you're using **TP-Link**, **D-Link**, and **Huawei** routers, here's the honest reality:

---

## 🔒 1. **Most Consumer Routers (TP-Link, D-Link, Huawei)** do **not** offer public APIs for:

* Blocking users programmatically,
* Monitoring data usage per device in real time,
* Integrating directly with Django.

Instead, they usually provide:

* Web admin panels (manual control),
* Limited SNMP support (for monitoring only),
* Some routers offer **telnet/SSH** under the hood (but not well-documented or secure),
* Mobile app APIs (but **private/undocumented** and hard to reverse-engineer).

---

## 🧩 Workaround Strategies

If you're still determined, here are **3 viable strategies**:

---

### 🔹 Option 1: Use SNMP for Monitoring (Not Blocking)

Some models support **SNMP**, which can be used to **monitor traffic usage** (not block). You can:

* Enable SNMP on your router,
* Use Python with `pysnmp` to poll interface or per-host data usage,
* Log it into Django.

⚠️ **Limitation**: No blocking via SNMP. Only read access.

---

### 🔹 Option 2: Use `arp` + IP Tables on Linux Gateway (Best Control)

If you control the **router OS** (e.g. if you flash with **OpenWRT/DD-WRT** or use a Linux box as a gateway), you can:

1. Detect users via ARP scan,
2. Use `iptables` to block traffic by IP or MAC,
3. Build a Django app to trigger these blocks.

🛠️ Tools:

* `arp-scan` to detect active users
* `iptables` or `nftables` for blocking
* Django to manage rules/logs

This method is **reliable** and **automatable**, but requires you to control the network gateway.

---

### 🔹 Option 3: Reverse Engineer the Router's Web Interface

You might be able to:

* **Simulate login** to the web interface using Python (`requests`),
* **Send POST requests** to block a user (like clicking "Block" in the admin panel).

⚠️ **Highly device-specific, insecure, and brittle** (breaks on firmware updates).

Example (hypothetical, for TP-Link):

```python
import requests

session = requests.Session()
# Login first
session.post("http://192.168.0.1/login", data={"username": "admin", "password": "admin"})
# Block a user (you'd need to inspect the form or JS to know the exact call)
session.post("http://192.168.0.1/block_user", data={"ip": "192.168.0.105"})
```

> 🔍 You'll need to inspect the web admin panel using browser DevTools to figure out what API endpoints (if any) exist.

---

## ✅ Best Recommendation

If you want:

* **Full programmatic control** (block users, monitor usage),
* **Secure, stable automation**,

👉 Use a **custom router OS** like **OpenWRT**, **DD-WRT**, or a **Linux-based router/firewall** (like pfSense).

With those, you can:

* Run your own scripts or REST API,
* Integrate directly with Django,
* Have total control over network devices.

---

## Want to Proceed?

Let me know:

* Which of the 3 options above you're open to,
* Whether you're able to install OpenWRT/DD-WRT or set up a Linux gateway,
* If you're okay only monitoring usage (not blocking).

And I’ll help you build that setup step-by-step.



You're looking to:

### 🧩 **Block users' data usage on a router using a web API**, and

### 🗃️ **Log/save that data to a database via Django**.

That’s totally doable, but this involves multiple layers of networking, API integration, and Django. Here's how to approach this step-by-step:

---

## ✅ STEP 1: Understand Your Router Capabilities

To **block or monitor users on a router**, you need to:

1. **Access the router's API or interface**:

   * Some routers (e.g., MikroTik, Ubiquiti, OpenWRT, DD-WRT) provide a **Web API, SSH, or SNMP** to control access.
   * Consumer routers (like TP-Link, D-Link) may not expose these features easily unless flashed with custom firmware.

🔧 **Questions to answer first**:

* What **router make/model** are you using?
* Does it support **APIs or CLI scripting**?
* Are you tracking by **IP, MAC address, or user account**?

---

## ✅ STEP 2: Set Up the Router to Block Users

Depending on your router type:

### 🔹 Example: MikroTik (via RouterOS API or SSH)

You can block a user by their IP like this:

```shell
/ip firewall filter add chain=forward src-address=192.168.88.10 action=drop
```

This can be automated via:

* Python using `paramiko` (SSH)
* MikroTik API using `librouteros`
* Shell script triggered from Django

---

## ✅ STEP 3: Use Django to Manage Users and Block Requests

### Example: Django Model to Track Users

```python
# models.py
class UserDevice(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    ip_address = models.GenericIPAddressField()
    mac_address = models.CharField(max_length=17)
    blocked = models.BooleanField(default=False)
    last_blocked_time = models.DateTimeField(null=True, blank=True)
```

### Example: Django View to Trigger Block

```python
import subprocess
from django.utils import timezone
from django.http import JsonResponse
from .models import UserDevice

def block_user(request, user_id):
    user = UserDevice.objects.get(pk=user_id)
    
    # Sample command to block IP on router (adjust for your router!)
    command = f"ssh admin@192.168.1.1 '/ip firewall filter add chain=forward src-address={user.ip_address} action=drop'"
    
    result = subprocess.run(command, shell=True)
    
    if result.returncode == 0:
        user.blocked = True
        user.last_blocked_time = timezone.now()
        user.save()
        return JsonResponse({'status': 'success'})
    else:
        return JsonResponse({'status': 'error', 'details': 'Command failed'})
```

> You can make this available via Django admin or a REST API.

---

## ✅ STEP 4: Save Logs of Usage/Blocking

Track blocked events, data usage, etc., using models:

```python
class BlockLog(models.Model):
    user = models.ForeignKey(UserDevice, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    action = models.CharField(max_length=10, choices=[('block', 'Block'), ('unblock', 'Unblock')])
    timestamp = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
```

---

## ✅ Optional: Build a Frontend or Dashboard

You can make a Django admin panel or React/Vue dashboard to:

* See who's connected
* Click to block/unblock
* View usage logs

---

## ✅ Summary

| Task                         | Tool/Tech                             |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Control router (block IP)    | SSH/API (depends on router)           |
| Web app/API to trigger block | Django + subprocess / API client      |
| Store data                   | Django ORM (PostgreSQL / SQLite etc.) |
| UI to manage                 | Django Admin or React/Vue frontend    |

🔍 **Let me know your router model** or how you'd like to track users (IP/MAC), and I can show you the exact integration code or commands.





Great! Since you said “yes,” I’ll assume you’re interested in integrating Firebase with Django.

To give you **the best setup**, I just need a bit more detail:

### 👉 What exactly are you planning to use Firebase for?

Pick one or more:

1. **Firestore or Realtime Database** — to store and retrieve data?
2. **Firebase Authentication** — for user login/signup?
3. **Firebase Cloud Storage** — for file uploads (e.g. images)?
4. **Cloud Messaging / Notifications**?
5. Something else?

---

### 🧩 Example Use Case

If you want to **store user profiles in Firebase Firestore** and still use Django for an admin panel or API, your setup would look like this:

#### 1. **Install Firebase Admin SDK**

```bash
pip install firebase-admin
```

#### 2. **Initialize Firebase in Django**

Put this in a new file like `firebase_config.py`:

```python
import firebase_admin
from firebase_admin import credentials, firestore

cred = credentials.Certificate('path/to/your-service-account-key.json')
firebase_admin.initialize_app(cred)

db = firestore.client()
```

#### 3. **Use It in Views or Services**

```python
from .firebase_config import db

def add_user_to_firestore(user_id, name, email):
    doc_ref = db.collection('users').document(user_id)
    doc_ref.set({
        'name': name,
        'email': email
    })
```
